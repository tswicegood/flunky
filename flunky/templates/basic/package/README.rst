Simple Python Package
=====================
The files in this directory are used to build the ``package`` portion of the
the new Flunky package.  These files will be run through a template engine.
They are currently not valid Python.

This file will *not* be included in the final output.  See
``flunk/templates/basic/__init__.py`` for more information.
